The project is structured as follows:

- **Data Collection**: Users input their daily habits and goals through the interface. The data is stored in a local database for persistence.
- **Data Processing**: The tool processes the input data to generate insights and visualizations. Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib are used for data manipulation and visualization.
- **User Interface**: A simple command-line interface (CLI) is implemented to interact with the user. The interface allows users to input their habits, set goals, and view progress.
- **Error Handling**: The code includes error handling mechanisms to manage issues such as invalid inputs and database errors.
