# Higher Lower Game

Welcome to the Higher Lower Game project! This Python program is a fun game where you have to guess whether the next number will be higher or lower than the current one. It's a great way to practice Python programming and understand basic game logic.

## Author

This project was created by [Pratyush Kumar Jha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratyush-kumar-jha-b37a57235/).

## Features

- Generates a random sequence of numbers.
- Prompts the user to guess whether the next number will be higher or lower.
- Simple and interactive command-line interface.

## Installation

To run this program, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/UniteUniverse/Python-Programs.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd Python-Programs/Project\ 12\ Higher_Lower_Game
```

## Usage

To start the higher lower game, run the `Project_12_Higher_Lower_Game.py` script:

```sh
python Project_12_Higher_Lower_Game.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to guess whether the next number will be higher or lower.

## Example

Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```sh
Welcome to the Higher Lower Game!
Current number: 5
Will the next number be higher or lower? Type 'h' or 'l': h
Next number: 7
You guessed it right!
```

## How the Code is Made

The Higher Lower Game code is made using Python's basic input and output functions, along with the `random` module to generate random numbers. Here's a brief overview of how the code works:

1. **Importing the `random` Module**: The `random` module is imported to generate random numbers.

2. **Setting Up the Game**: The game welcomes the player and generates an initial random number.

3. **Game Loop**: A `while` loop is used to repeatedly prompt the player to guess whether the next number will be higher or lower.
    - The player's guess is compared to the next randomly generated number.
    - Feedback is provided ("You guessed it right!" or "Wrong guess").
    - The loop continues until the player decides to stop.

4. **Ending the Game**: Once the player decides to stop, the game thanks the player for playing.
