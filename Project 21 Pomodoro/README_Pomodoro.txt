# Pomodoro Timer

Welcome to the Pomodoro Timer project! This Python program implements a Pomodoro timer using a graphical user interface (GUI) created with the `tkinter` module. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Author

This project was created by [Pratyush Kumar Jha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratyush-kumar-jha-b37a57235/).

## Features

- Implements the Pomodoro Technique for time management.
- Simple and interactive GUI created with the `tkinter` module.
- Customizable work and break intervals.
- Visual and audio alerts for work and break periods.

## Installation

To run this program, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/UniteUniverse/Python-Programs.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd Python-Programs/Project\ 21\ Pomodoro
```

## Usage

To start the Pomodoro Timer, run the `Project_21_Pomodoro.py` script:

```sh
python Project_21_Pomodoro.py
```

The program will open a window where you can start the timer and follow the Pomodoro Technique.

## Example

Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```sh
A window opens with a start button. After starting, the timer counts down from 25 minutes, signaling the end of the work period and the beginning of the break period.
```

## How the Code is Made

The Pomodoro Timer code is made using Python's `tkinter` module for the GUI. Here's a brief overview of how the code works:

1. **Importing the `tkinter` Module**: The `tkinter` module is imported to create the GUI.

2. **Setting Up the GUI**: The main window is set up with labels, buttons, and a canvas for the timer display.

3. **Defining the Timer Functionality**: Functions are defined to start the timer, count down the time, and switch between work and break intervals. The timer uses the `after` method to update the display every second.

4. **Handling User Input**: The user can start the timer, and the program will manage the intervals automatically, providing visual and audio alerts.

5. **Customizing Intervals**: The work and break intervals can be customized by modifying the code. The default intervals are 25 minutes for work and 5 minutes for breaks.
