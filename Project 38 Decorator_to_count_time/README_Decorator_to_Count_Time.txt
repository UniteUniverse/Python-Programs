## Introduction

The Decorator to Count Time Project is a simple yet powerful tool that allows developers to measure the execution time of their functions easily. By using this decorator, developers can gain insights into the performance of their code and make necessary optimizations.

## Features

- Measure the execution time of any function
- Easy to integrate with existing code
- User-friendly and minimalistic design
- Provides clear and concise output

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UniteUniverse/Python-Programs.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Python-Programs/Project\ 38\ Decorator_to_count_time
```

3. Install the required dependencies (if any):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the Decorator to Count Time, import the decorator and apply it to your functions:

```python
from time_decorator import time_decorator

@time_decorator
def your_function():
    # Your code here
```

Run your script, and the decorator will output the execution time of the decorated function.

## How the Code is Made

The project is structured as follows:

- **Decorator Implementation**: The time_decorator is implemented using Python's built-in time module. It wraps around the target function and measures the time taken for its execution.
- **User Interface**: The decorator provides clear and concise output to the console, indicating the execution time of the decorated function.
- **Error Handling**: The code includes error handling mechanisms to ensure that the decorator works smoothly with various types of functions.
