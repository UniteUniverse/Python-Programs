  - [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) for stock prices
  - [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) for news articles

- **Data Processing**: The collected data is processed and analyzed to extract meaningful insights. Python libraries such as Pandas and Numpy are utilized for data manipulation.

- **User Interface**: A simple command-line interface (CLI) is implemented to interact with the user. The interface prompts the user for input and displays the results in a readable format.

- **Error Handling**: The code includes error handling mechanisms to manage issues such as network errors, API limits, and invalid inputs.
