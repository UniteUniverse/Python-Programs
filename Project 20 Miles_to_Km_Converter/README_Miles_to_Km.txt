# Miles to Km Converter

Welcome to the Miles to Km Converter project! This Python program converts distances from miles to kilometers using a simple graphical user interface (GUI) created with the `tkinter` module. It's a useful tool for quick and easy conversion between these two units of measurement.

## Author

This project was created by [Pratyush Kumar Jha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratyush-kumar-jha-b37a57235/).

## Features

- Converts distances from miles to kilometers.
- Simple and interactive GUI created with the `tkinter` module.
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

## Installation

To run this program, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/UniteUniverse/Python-Programs.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd Python-Programs/Project\ 20\ Miles_to_Km_Converter
```

## Usage

To use the Miles to Km Converter, run the `Project_20_Miles_to_Km_Converter.py` script:

```sh
python Project_20_Miles_to_Km_Converter.py
```

The program will open a window where you can enter a distance in miles and click the "Convert" button to see the equivalent distance in kilometers.

## Example

Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```sh
A window opens with a field to enter the distance in miles. After entering a value and clicking "Convert", the equivalent distance in kilometers is displayed.
```

## How the Code is Made

The Miles to Km Converter code is made using Python's `tkinter` module for the GUI. Here's a brief overview of how the code works:

1. **Importing the `tkinter` Module**: The `tkinter` module is imported to create the GUI.

2. **Setting Up the GUI**: The main window is set up with labels, entry fields, and buttons.

3. **Conversion Function**: A function is defined to convert the entered distance from miles to kilometers. The conversion factor (1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers) is used.

4. **Handling User Input**: The user enters a distance in miles, and the conversion function is called when the "Convert" button is clicked. The result is displayed in the GUI.

5. **Handling Invalid Inputs**: The program checks for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values) and displays an appropriate message.
