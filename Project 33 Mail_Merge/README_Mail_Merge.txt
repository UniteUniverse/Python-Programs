- **Email Generation**: The tool merges the recipient details with the email template to create personalized emails. Python libraries such as Jinja2 are used for template rendering.
- **Email Sending**: The tool integrates with email services (e.g., SMTP) to send the personalized emails. Libraries such as smtplib and email are used for email communication.
- **Error Handling**: The code includes error handling mechanisms to manage issues such as invalid email addresses and network errors. Logs are maintained for successful and failed email deliveries.
