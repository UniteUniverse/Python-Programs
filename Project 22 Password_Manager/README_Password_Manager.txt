## Features

- Securely stores and manages passwords.
- Generates strong passwords.
- Simple and interactive GUI created with the `tkinter` module.
- Saves passwords to a file for future reference.

## Installation

To run this program, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/UniteUniverse/Python-Programs.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd Python-Programs/Project\ 22\ Password_Manager
```

## Usage

To start the Password Manager, run the `Project_22_Password_Manager.py` script:

```sh
python Project_22_Password_Manager.py
```

The program will open a window where you can add new passwords, generate strong passwords, and save them securely.

## Example

Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```sh
A window opens with fields to enter website, email/username, and password. You can generate a strong password or save the entered password to a file.
```

## How the Code is Made

The Password Manager code is made using Python's `tkinter` module for the GUI. Here's a brief overview of how the code works:

1. **Importing the `tkinter` Module**: The `tkinter` module is imported to create the GUI.

2. **Setting Up the GUI**: The main window is set up with labels, entry fields, and buttons for website, email/username, and password.

3. **Generating Strong Passwords**: A function is defined to generate strong passwords using a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters. The `random` module is used to randomize the characters.

4. **Saving Passwords**: A function is defined to save the entered passwords to a file. The passwords are saved in a text file for future reference.

5. **Handling User Input**: The user can enter website, email/username, and password, generate a strong password, and save the password to a file using the provided buttons.
