# NATO Alphabet

Welcome to the NATO Alphabet project! This Python program converts words into their corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet representation. It's a useful tool for learning the NATO phonetic alphabet and for use in communication to ensure clarity.

## Author

This project was created by [Pratyush Kumar Jha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratyush-kumar-jha-b37a57235/).

## Features

- Converts words into NATO phonetic alphabet.
- Simple and interactive command-line interface.
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

## Installation

To run this program, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

You will also need the `pandas` module to handle the data.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/UniteUniverse/Python-Programs.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd Python-Programs/Project\ 19\ NATO_Alphabet
```

3. Install the required `pandas` module if you don't have it already:

```sh
pip install pandas
```

## Usage

To convert a word into the NATO phonetic alphabet, run the `Project_19_NATO_Alphabet.py` script:

```sh
python Project_19_NATO_Alphabet.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to enter a word, and the program will display the NATO phonetic alphabet representation.

## Example

Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```sh
Enter a word: Hello
Hotel Echo Lima Lima Oscar
```

## How the Code is Made

The NATO Alphabet code is made using Python's basic input and output functions, along with the `pandas` module to handle the NATO alphabet data. Here's a brief overview of how the code works:

1. **Importing Modules**: The `pandas` module is imported to read the NATO alphabet data.

2. **Loading NATO Alphabet Data**: The NATO alphabet data is loaded from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

3. **Creating a Dictionary**: A dictionary is created from the DataFrame to map each letter to its corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet word.

4. **User Input**: The user is prompted to enter a word.

5. **Conversion**: The input word is converted into its NATO phonetic alphabet representation by iterating through each letter and looking up the corresponding word in the dictionary.

6. **Handling Invalid Inputs**: The program handles invalid inputs gracefully by ignoring non-alphabetic characters.
