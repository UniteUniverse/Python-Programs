# Caesar Cipher

Welcome to the Caesar Cipher project! This Python program implements the classic Caesar Cipher encryption technique, allowing you to encrypt and decrypt messages with a simple shift cipher. It's a great way to learn about basic encryption methods and practice Python programming.

## Author

This project was created by [Pratyush Kumar Jha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratyush-kumar-jha-b37a57235/).

## Features

- Encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar Cipher technique.
- Allows customization of the shift value.
- Simple and interactive command-line interface.

## Installation

To run this program, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/UniteUniverse/Python-Programs.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd Python-Programs/Project\ 8\ Ceaser_Cipher
```

## Usage

To encrypt or decrypt a message, run the `Project_8_Ceaser_Cipher.py` script:

```sh
python Project_8_Ceaser_Cipher.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your message, choose the shift value, and select whether to encrypt or decrypt the message.

## Example

Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```sh
Welcome to Caesar Cipher!
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
> encode
Type your message:
> hello
Type the shift number:
> 5
Here's the encoded result: mjqqt
```
